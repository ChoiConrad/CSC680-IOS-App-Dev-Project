# CSC680-IOS-App-Dev-Project
Final Project for CSC 680 Application Development for Mobile Devices 

### Idea:
My idea for my IOS Application is to teach children how to program. The idea stems from my nephew is already addicted to technology. People say that children are sponges when it comes to information. I want make an application where he will have some basic understanding. This is done by having him interact segments of code in the shape of blocks and the child will drag the blocks into correct locations.
