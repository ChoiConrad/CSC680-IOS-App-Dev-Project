# CSC680-IOS-App-Dev-Project
Final Project for CSC 680 Application Development for Mobile Devices by Conrad Choi 

### Idea: Good Finance Bad Calculator 
 This calculator will do everything a loan calculator will do but on the cellphone. This idea stemmed from when I was buying a Car and was trying to find out my monthly payment. 

### Features for Loan Calculator: 
The features of this application is to calculate monthly payments, time remaining on payments, Total money spent with the interest and compare it to buying it outright. However if a user wishes to have, for example certain monthly payment the app will offer how to achieve the certain monthly payments. the suggested payments will be structured suggested to least suggested in terms of suggested finance decisions. 
This application will be implementing gyroscope to input the user information. For example if someone wants to input their finance percentage for a car they are buying they need to tilt the screen so the arrow will slide to the correct percentage. 

### Why?
The process for buying a vehicle is difficult, this app will achieve making the buying process and any financial advice given even more difficult to obtain. 


### API for UI 
The api that I will be using for the UI is called Core Motion https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion this is to utilize the gyroscope or orientation of the iphone to set the number. 

### Rough UI of the Applications
